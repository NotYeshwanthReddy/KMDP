# An approach for optimizing algorithms which find k1-most demanding products
#### Abstract: 
This paper focuses on optimising the process of finding the k1-most demanding products using traditional algorithms and clustering. We have used 4 clustering algorithms over 2 traditional algorithms to optimise the time for finding k1-most demanding products. A synthetic data set was used for demonstration and the results are plotted in a graph for comparison. This approach can be used in various fields for optimisation purpose.
